A coilgun is a type of mass driver. It contains one or more electromagnets to accelerate a ferromagnetic projectile to a high velocity. This project is a design of a toy level multi-stage coilgun. We'd like to make it easy to implement, so people can build it as a hobby project.

NOTE: Please turn on git LFS when cloning this project.

## Design

The principle of our design, and a detailed introduction of subsystems are in [Design](Doc/Design.md)

## Disclaimer

A coilgun is operated by **LETHALLY** high voltage and current. If you don't have enough knowledge and experiences on high voltage electric, please keep extreme cautions on insulation.

## Directories

* Circuit folder is the electric design of the system. The files can be open by [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/)
* Doc folder contains some documents
